      I am a web developer. I have gathered a lot of experience throughout my
      web development career. I have a great experience with React.js as well as
      some good hands-on experience with backend development using Node.js, PHP,
      Laravel, and a little bit of Django. I also have some AWS knowledge. I
      love when my imagination comes to life as a website. I also have Graphics
      Designing, Video Editing, and Sound Mastering skills.
